This project may look disorganized, and in fact, it is disorganized. But weâ€™ll be shaping it up later. If you want more context, this repository is for my YouTube series on solving the Advent of Code in different programming languages.

# How to Build

Yo have to generate the build with CMAKE.

you can use (`SOW_STD_EXAMPLES` cmake variable to `OFF`) if you do not want to compile the standard library examples.

then go to the generated build directory and do `make` or IDK. build the project with the tools you selected.

# TODO

- name the functions a little bit better bro.
- `S_split` have segfault if the str passed is null!.
- in MAX, MIN, macros, please, cast data to the corresponding type to ensure void* arrays works ok. in smath.h
- `S_to_hex_format` needs refactor weird unsigned char, just build and you will see.
