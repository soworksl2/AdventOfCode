This project may look disorganized, and in fact, it is disorganized. But weâ€™ll be shaping it up later. If you want more context, this repository is for my YouTube series on solving the Advent of Code in different programming languages.

# How to Build

Yo have to generate the build with CMAKE.

you can use (`SOW_STD_EXAMPLES` cmake variable to `OFF`) if you do not want to compile the standard library examples.

then go to the generated build directory and do `make` or IDK. build the project with the tools you selected.

# TODO

- organice day1 and day2 to use the `std_sow` standard library.
- separate header files from sources files in the `sow_std` library.
